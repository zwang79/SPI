Implement full SPI (serial peripheral interface) function, including sampling of slow clock signal in order to control data transmission, read and write operations of register array. RTL implementation is based on Verilog and synthesized with Synopsys tool. Placement and routing are conducted with ICC tools and power analysis is also included.
